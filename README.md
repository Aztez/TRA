This is repository for data structures and algorithms course work done with C. The algorith compares the vocabulary of two large text files by finding the 50 first different words from one file that do not occur in the second file. A continuous string of characters a..z and A..Z, with possible apostrophes ’, is considered a word. Words with uppercase and lowercase letters are considered
equal. For example, in the text

Herman Melville’s book Moby Dick starts, as we all know, with the sentence ”Call me Ishmael”.

the words are

herman, melville’s, book, moby, dick, starts, as, we, all, know, with, the, sentence, call, me, and ishmael

The name of the text files are given as input from the user. The program prints from the first file the 50 first different words that do not occur in the second file. The words are printed in the order that they occur in the first file. Some example txt files are provided in the src folder.
